# Demo date interval component (Typescript)

Made from [Material Start ES6 Tutorial](https://github.com/angular/material-start/tree/es6-tutorial).

Some notes:

- Last month button susctract exact month (in requirements 30 days)

- datesChanges fires before update the bindings in parent component (log previous values)

- sometimes datePicker shows as invalid style (with bottom red line)
